# DevOpsStories
This repository talks about our DevOps stories. What we learnt; what we observed; mistakes we made.

## Content flow
The flow of the content is simple. The author talks about his or her DevOps learnings therefore the content written is in first person. 
Each section or story is not longer than few lines (maybe 5 lines) to ensure the content remains crisp.
The content flow is almost always:
- What was the problem identified
- What was the impact 
- What was the solution
All these aspects are in a story telling format

## Author commitment
Each author is committed to writing atleast 5 lines on a given page each day
