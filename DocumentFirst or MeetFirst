# Document First Organization

Have you been part of teams where all decisions are made on meetings?
Have you been part of groups where you need to meet to get the ball rolling for even small decisions? 
Do you have a boss who loves to block your calendar to discuss more? 
Do you feel you are spending too much time on meeting?
Are you meeting your own team members in formal meeting discussions for several hours a week? 
If all this resonates with you then you are a meet first organization.

In this post I'm going to be talking about 2 types of organizations.
1.	The meeting first organization
2.	The document first organization
